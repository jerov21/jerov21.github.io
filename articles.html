	<div>I have many interests. They span from sports to global issues, history to science. I plan to write aboout these topics and many more and attempt to make seemingly difficult concepts understandable for a wider audience. Please forgive any grammatical or other errors, for now. Though I enjoy the struggle of writing, I have no formal training. I do as much research as I feel is appropriate for each article but mistakes may still exist. 

	I try to have a good understanding of a topic before I write about it, however I don't claim to be an expert on any topic.
